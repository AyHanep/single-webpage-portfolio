           <span class="text4">I am Kenneth M. Famarin, second year BSIT student. Most of all I'm a lazy person when I get tired of something
            I will not do it also I give them a reminder that I'm not going to do it if the task is important I will 
            take consideration sometimes. People misunderstand my concept of being lazy, they think being lazy is universal 
            to my personality but they're wrong if there's a responsibility that needs to be done or given responsibility by others,
            I will do it fast as possible. My personality is like a all rounder sometimes I'm shy or active to be sociable,
            and people misunderstand it alot like I said I do things that I like if not you know the answer, also responsibility
            and requirements is another thing.</span>
